    External:
        numpy 1.26.2
        pandas 2.1.3
        matplotlib 3.8.2
        tensorflow 2.15.0

        time

INSTRUCTIONS:
    1. Navigate to the directory with the "main.py" script and "functions.py" script 
       as well as the "Training_DataSet.csv" and "Test_Dataset.csv"
    
    2. Either through the terminal or with a Python IDE, run "main.py" for the end-to-end process 
       for a Random Forest Regression and Classification model (My choice of ML model).
    
    3. I have run tests with other ML models to determine the best one for this task. If you would 
       like to see the process/comparison of the other models, navigate to "main.py" beginning 
       from line 42 and follow the commented instructions within the code. (This will train the other models
       and show the output metrics for them, however the models that generate the test set predictions will 
       remain as Random Forest models
